### *Technologies We Use*

- *OptiTrack Motive* for motion capture and data streaming, *OptiTrack Live Link Plugin* for integrating data into Unreal Engine, and *MetaHumans* for realistic digital character animation.

### *Getting Started*
- *Motive*:  Used for setting up the motion capture environment, including camera calibration and skeleton creation. It streams real-time data to Unreal Engine using the OptiTrack Live Link Plugin.
- *Unreal*: Utilizes the Live Link Plugin to receive motion data from Motive and applies it to digital characters like MetaHumans, enabling real-time animation.
