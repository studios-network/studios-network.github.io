# Motive and Unreal Setup Guide

## Introduction
This guide will help you set up and integrate Motive and Unreal Engine for motion capture and animation projects.

## Step 1: Launch Motive.
   - Upon launch, you may notice all cameras in a straight line, indicating they are not calibrated. (image)

## Step 2: Calibrate the Cameras:
   - For a thorough explanation on how to calibrate the cameras, see this video. [Optitrack Calibration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZ_CApepS6SpNlUBTgoetyYuwgrFyXnU/view)

Calibrate the cameras in the following situations:
   - After a system restart
   - When blue rings on the cameras turn off (indicating disconnection)
   - Following any modifications to the truss setup
   - If you sense irregularities in camera performance
Hereâ€™s a visual of the post-calibrated cameras. (image)

## Step 3: Camera Orientation
After calibration, orient the cameras:
   - *Switch to Grayscale Mode:* Right-click on each camera in Motive one at a time and change the mode to Grayscale for a clearer view. (image)
   - *Adjust Orientation:* Right-click again and select "Orientation" to adjust the camera angles, ideally in 90-degree increments. Note that Motive allows adjustments in 5-degree increments. (image)
   - *Return to Object Mode:* Once oriented, switch the cameras back to Object mode. (image)
